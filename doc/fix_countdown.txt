fix countdown command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID countdown Nevery Nprint :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
countdown = style name of this fix command :l
Nevery = measure time over so many time steps :l
Nprint = print countdown info every Nprint steps :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix doom all countdown 10 10000

[Description:]

Print a countdown message every {Nprint} steps during a simulation run
indicating the percentage of completion and the estimated time to completion.
The time to completion estimate is based on a weighted average time 
collected every {Nevery} steps. If {Nprint} is smaller than 1, no output
is printed, but data is still collected.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.  None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options
are relevant to this fix.

This fix computes a global scalar and a global vector with 4 elements, which
can be accessed by various "output commands"_Section_howto.html#howto_15.
The scalar is the completion fraction (i.e. a number between 0.0 and 1.0);
the vector contains the estimated remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

No parameter of this fix can be used with the {start/stop} keywords of the "run"_run.html command.

This fix is not invoked during "energy minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:] none
